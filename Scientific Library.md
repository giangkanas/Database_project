# database-project
In this project, we have to create a simple app that helps the user to search and manage scientific articles that exist in a database. 

In the first part of the project, we had to think about the use of our database. After that, we created the Entity Relational Diagram (ERD) of our problem.

In the second part, we had to make the transaction from logical model (ERD) to relational model (tables)

In the third part, we created our database using MySQL.

Last but not least, we created a simple app (Python) for using the database.
